This is an experimental project for adding beanfabrics support
to SWT components.

To compile and run the examples add the following libraries 
from the eclipse plugins directory to the classpath:

- org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx_*.jar
- org.eclipse.swt.layout.grouplayout/swt-grouplayout.jar
- org.eclipse.swt.widgets.baseline/baseline.jar
- org.eclipse.swt_*.jar
